# High school syndicate
## Prologue


Wilkins pushed the door of the office open a tad, then tiptoed inside and placed the parcel on Mr. Antoniou’s desk. He was desperate. Four boys and girls had already denied the job. He quickly slipped out and closed the door.


“Ho-ho-Darrell, you got mail.” He frisbee'd the package, and, with a look of horror, watched it sail into the candle lying in the middle of the dinner table. His son quickly pulled it out and ripped the parcel open, only to find a short stack of papers. The title read:
APPLY FOR A JOB ONLY YOU CAN ACCEPT-A QUICK SURVEY
“So much for quick,” muttered Darrell under his breath. He took a quick look at the paper and tossed it into the fireplace.


The next day at school, a strange air hung in the hallways like streamers in a party. Every kid looked as if to hide something, and Darrell was the only person doing vice versa. He seemed to tap into that sense, unlike anyone else, but he still had a sour taste lingering in his mouth from yesterday. Why, he didn’t know. Perhaps he realized that he didn’t know who the sender was. Or he thought he got the wrong package. Maybe it was something else. His brain pondered about for the whole school day as he drifted into a state of near transcendence.
After school, just as he had unpacked his backpack, he noticed another parcel sitting in there. He pulled it out, remembering his obvious mistake of not reading the sender, and looked at the orange package. No markings of any kind.
His basement was a big clutter of his dad’s experiments and inventions. Quickly, Darrell snatched a uv magnifying glass off of a desk and scanned over the parcel. He pushed it into a half finished scanner and-Darrell stopped and let his eyes widen for a moment. The only fingerprints on the package were his!


Presuming this the work of an international scandaling triad bent and turning humans into donkeys, he remembered his father was a recycler and walked outside, trudged past the garage and over to the paper bin. Dumping it out, Darrell examined every scrap, his hands all dirty and smeared. He found nothing. Walking back inside, he decided to fill out the donkey-triad form.


After 17 pages of painful donkey-unrelated questions, Darrell continued his evening routine of dinner with his parents, starcraft with his friend Wilkins, and going to bed. But whereas he went to sleep at 7:00, Wilkins sat in the comforts of his penthouse apartment, dialing at his computer and checking the status of the parcel Darrell had received. He was sitting in the lounge on the top floor of the Vancouver House, micromanaging all his parcel inputs at once. 2 doors away from Darrell, Melissa Angels had also accepted, a block away, Wilkins’ best friend, Jasmine, had also done the same. 14 more acceptions had taken place. He smiled. “Back from the grave, Stanley.”


The next morning, after a terrible dream of all 6 of her puppies ripping her guts out, Jasmine awoke to find her survey lying neatly on the carpet next to her bed. She rolled off, stumbled over to it, and filed through. As she neared the end of the survey, something caught her eye. At the very last page of the survey, there was a black CD ROM tucked in a clear sleeve. Pulling it out, she tiptoed upstairs, as her parents were asleep, where she thought she might find a CD drive. After no luck searching top to bottom of the attic, She decided she must buy a drive herself.


The walk to Dollarama was short, but she made it seem like an hour by hypothesizing what would happen if she inserted the CD ROM into a player. Maybe it would activate a void ray that would split the earth in two. Or the player would explode, and millions more players would explode, causing a massacre that would up a criminal gang’s reputation. Her mind was cultivating a vast expanse of ideas that she didn’t accept. Especially because that item was lying in her knapsack slung over her back.
She walked into the store and was met by her favourite cashier, Tommy. He had a nice face with a strange humor and acceptance for whatever you said.


“So, Jazz, what’da ya lookin’ for?” Jasmine didn’t like him; they were just cousins that lived together.
“Just a CD player.” Her cousin laughed. “A what!?” Jasmine growled and slammed her hand on the counter. “Just. What. I. Said.” He chuckled.
“I’m not buying it.”
“Then buy it.”
“Nah-”
“Just. Find. It.”
“Is this a joke? 2 people already asked me that! Don’t mess with me!”
“I’m NOT!”
“Look in the scrapyard. We don’t have them.”


Sent on a wild goose chase, she stormed out of the store and to the bus stop.
It had begun to rain, a light drizzle of H20 that didn’t comfort Jasmine any as she stepped on the bus. Trickles of water sent the window wipers to work as an endless shower of tiny drips hailed down from the sky. Jasmine shuffled to the back of the empty bus and sat there for fifteen minutes until the driver announced that they had stopped. She jogged off the bus, onto another one, and waited for another five minutes before getting off and running to the scrapyard.


Jasmine had set a timer for 50 minutes. Under brief estimation, she guessed she had 20 minutes to find the CD player. She was safe. Scrabbling around the junk-filled aisles, Jasmine found a CD player taped next to the operator's door. Too busy driving the crane to notice, he continued happily as outside, Jasmine unzipped her knapsack and slid the CD into the player. She suddenly realized something very strange. As if tapping into the art of cliche, she noticed that it was too convenient to have found it just there. She quickly ran back to the room and, just as she was about to tape it back in place, the operator appeared outside. “What the-” He reached for a monkey wrench and hurled it at Jasmine, who expertly, but unknowingly dodged it, darting past a crate of bolts and hurling them at the operator.


She missed by two feet, sadly, and her pursuer laughed while he ran for Jasmine. She jogged backwards, turned left, and leapt over a crate while he tossed another monkey wrench that sailed over her head and onto a conveyer belt that lead to the crusher. She gulped, then swerved left.
She ended up right where she’d started, having gone in a loop. She was about to give up when she heard a voice call for her, lying in her knapsack: “Take me out-” She heard a slight whir in the machine. Quickly, she zipped behind a stack of expired World of Warcraft cards and pizza, the stench clogging her nose and churning her sick. Slowly, she reached around and plucked out the CD player.


Darrell, too, found another CD player lying on the sidewalk and picked it up, glanced around, and was about to slide the CD in when he started to question himself. Why a CD player? Because it could explode? He didn’t know. That’s when he realized he was doubting his own actions in the past two days. He’d come too far to turn back. He would just have to journey on.
Darrell stuck around a moment too long. Because that second, a man with a hoodie checked his pockets and yelled, “Hey! My player!” He whirled around and glanced at Darrell, who had taken off. The man started after him in an amazingly fast dash, catching up to him quickly. The pursued leapt onto a bus, the man did the same, and he leapt off as the doors were about to close. Luckily for the pursuer, Darrell had forced the driver to reopen the doors, giving him enough time to jump through also.


Darrell knew that plan wouldn’t work. So he tried another trick in the book. He whirled around the corner, found a busy road, and waited till the man was just behind him. Quickly, he darted forwards, and his pursuer had to stop to avoid the cars streaming ahead. Darrell had been lucky. But the next thing he knew, the man had clambered over the roofs of the cars and was full on sprinting at him yet again. He wondered how much adrenaline was being pumped into his blood right now.
Like clockwork, Darrell darted past a parking lot, past an angry shopper, and while the pursuer had hurled a bag of groceries at him, he zipped to one side of the lot, the man missing by an inch. He didn’t look back as he rushed up the escalator. His pursuer stopped to catch his breath, then jumped and ran up the stairs like a madman. The pursued swallowed and darted across the hall while the man was still on his heels and leapt across and onto a strut that ran the length of the mall. The man stopped and stood, waiting for him. “You won’t get my player!” Darrell balanced on the strut, feeling the sudden urge to look down. Gravity, or an unknown force, was pushing him side to side, up and down. Every part of his body was shriveling. He couldn’t act. One shuffle forward. Another tiny step. How much time before his parents found out he’d left? He checked his watch. It was 7:23. His parents usually got up at 7:30. He suddenly, and without will, felt himself dashing across the plank with no intention of balance in mind.


He miscalculated his first several steps by centimetres and slipped off, grabbing hold of the strut with seconds to spare. Everybody looked up and gasped. He was dangling 5 metres off the ground and had no chance of getting up. The plank was too smooth for grip, hence the reason why he’d been holding on via wrists. If he managed to get back up, he would have to slide down the pole sitting beside the bakery stand on the other side of the strut, which was unlikely to hold 98 pounds. But he considered another option. There was, of course, the player. It might tell him something useful. He also noticed a play area off to the side of the strut. If he gained enough momentum, he could swing across and land on plush and carpet safely. But then he glanced the man, making his way across the plank to get his player. He sharply decided he should use it. Taking it out, he slid the CD into the player and pressed play. There was a click and the player seemed to spontaneously combust. He pressed again. “Come on...” the player clicked on. “Hello. I see your situation.”


Wilkins looked at the second monitor, through the eyes of mall camera number 1, and switched the view to mall camera number two.
“Make the jump.” Darrell swung, back and forth, until he’d gained enough momentum. “Jump-” Wilkins didn’t get to finish his sentence. Darrell had leapt into the play area. “No!” Darrell, caught off guard, jumped, just as the man brought his foot down. He missed by an inch. Darrell flew into the carpeted space of the kids zone and slid down the sloping edges. He got up and darted, just as his pursuer was about to give up. “Nice. Make a left turn. A bike is waiting for you outside.”


“Pedal, as fast as you can, to Jasmine’s house.” He did, huffing as he biked up the hill and past an intersection of swearing drivers.
He arrived a few minutes later, swearing like the drivers a block away for following the crazy donkey triad voice. He had about a minute till his parents woke up. “Take the keys out of your pocket.” Suddenly, he felt the small, flat surface of what could either be his phone or, as the mysterious, masculine voice said, a key. The voice was correct. He slid the key into the top lock, like the voice had instructed, and turned the lock to unlock the door. Tiptoeing inside, he went over to Jasmine’s bedroom, where a tranquilizer dart lay, and grabbed it off her bedside table. He snooped around to another room, his footsteps silent on the muffling carpet. Darrell ninja tiptoed past the slightly open door and into Jasmine’s parents’ room, crawled beside each, and exchanged the tranquilizer drug between either parent. They snapped awake in an instant, clambering out of bed and facing him with horror. “What-” Darrell bolted out of the room, down the hall, and leapt over the railing to do a wall climb, just as he’d been taught by his brother, who lived with a group of upstarts. He ran downstairs and found, in the kitchen, another tranquilizer. Isn’t two tranq-darts overkill?, he thought. He was rushing for the door, found it magically locked, and turned around to face his demise. The two crept forward with straight, cold faces like every chinese movie star does, and smiled. “We report to police-a. You not-a break in here-a-” both collapsed on the floor in a heap, lying over each other like corpses. He laughed. “Leave them there. Your door is open.”


Melissa Angels, however, had arranged for that, and Jasmine was busy locking her door so that Melissa would go to her friend’s house. The motive for that was unknown.


Wilkins typed up a small chunk of Unix-B code, a code language that he’d made completely from scratch. “You will meet me at 7/11, aisle 4, the man staring at the gummy bears with a three-brand cigar in his hand, wearing a grey cloak with straightened cuffs. Also a top hat and cane made of deep wenge and branded with one gold ring at the bottom. 3:15, 0 milliseconds, 0 nanoseconds, get there sharp. Don’t make any audible contact about this.” Darrell’s head was about to explode. “What-” he realized he wasn’t able to talk to him.
He, on the way to 7/11, bumped into Jasmine and Melissa, who were flirting wildly. “-and then James raises both eyebrows, leans back, and says,
‘So it’s the whole package you want? Gee, gollum, I thought you were, mmm, reaching your peak in terms of helplessness.’” They laughed like mad scientists before running headlong into Darrell, who was chuckling himself. “So, ladies, whatcha doin’?” They looked at each other. “Going to 7/11.”
“Really? It’s a small world.”
“Yeah. You’re coming too?”
“Of course! The slurpees fuel my blood.”


They all walked to aisle 4, stopped a second and an eighth, turned the corner, saw the man staring at the gummy bears with the three brand cigar and cane. Darrell stopped. “You know this guy?”
“Do you?”
“No.”
“Wait...why are we all standing here, staring at this incredibly short man?” Jasmine realized they all were doing the same. “I dunno,” she answered, “Maybe the mail.” She silently cursed herself. “Or...any other chore.” Darrell caught on. “Yeah, I was thinking the same thing too.”


Jasmine thought about it. “So why are you staring at this man?”
“Dunno.” She was about to step forwards to meet the man when Darrell stopped her. “There’s no brand on his cane-” He covered his mouth. His stomach queased. Jasmine’s eyes widened past the size of soccer balls. “Wow, you-” she smiled with a look of surprise. He nodded shamefully. The man with the no-branded cane walked away, and they waited, pretending to shop and look around in the nearly deserted 7/11.
Minutes later, another short man, dressed in a nearly white coat that reached his feet, shuffled past them and stared intently at the gummy worms. Darrell noticed. “His coats too white. Plus, it’s 3:14 and 38 seconds.” There was another half a minute passing and two men dressed identically and matching the description, staring at what appeared to be the same spot: the gummy bears. Darrell shuffled over behind the men, and after a brief moment, declared that the man on the right was the correct one to choose. Jasmine followed, but Melissa went for the other man. “Why are you doing that?” Jasmine mouthed. Melissa pulled her back, behind the aisle. “That dope’s just trying to drag you down the ranks. i’ll be the one to get the job.” Jasmine narrowed her eyes down to Melissa’s. “And I wondered how you were so low on that popularity scale.”
“They won’t admit I’m the best. they just know that sooner or later, they’ll have to accept the glory that is Melissa Angels.” Her friend huffed. “Fine. Lose the job.”


Melissa and Jasmine went their separate ways and drastically different fates.
“Excuse me, sir?” The supposedly old man turned, shuffling on his stumpy legs...and it was Demse Henwinson, Wilkins’ younger brother. “Well, you’ve set a record. two nanoseconds and five hundred-thirty attoseconds early, though.” Jasmine and Darrell stared at each other with a look of awe. “I hope it’s not a joke, Demse.”
“Far from it. Very far when your ambitions are too high for jokes.” He walked towards the door that lead behind the shop. “Come with me.”
He led them through a maze of crates and stopped at the end of the shop. “remove the crate that’s third from the left.” Darrell did so. “Climb in there.” he went first, and the two followed.


They ended up in a dirt shaft with a low ceiling. Crawling along, they reached the end and found a small door made out of scrapped metal. The trio crawled through it like a doggy door and found themselves in a makeshift basket. Demse clambered around till he found a bulky, 90’s player and hit the fast forward button three times. There was a horrible grinding noise, dust filled the air, and Demse handed the two safety goggles before putting his own on. They slowly descended at a snail’s pace.
“Why did you set up such an elaborate scheme?” Demse replied like the flash. “The survey was useless. Whether it was a stack of lecture papers or not, you’d have still passed the test.”
“Oh...so you’re saying that we filled out the test for nothing!?” Demse laughed. “Hardly.”
“For a 9 year-old boy, you are cruel.”
“The first test was your stubbornness. Denying the first time was good. But if you had denied the second time, that would prove too stubborn for us.
“The second test was perseverance. You went to bed, got out and found the player and, Jasmine, you went to dollarama. When we hid the CD players, Tommy just denied existence. Yet still, you sought the player.” Darrell was seeing the bigger picture.
“As for you, Darrell, it was about what you did with that player. If you just handed it to him, that would have been prissy girl style. You would’ve gone home.
“And you passed that test. Now down to the last one: deduction and observation. Jasmine, well done, Darrell, excellent-o!” He flourished his hands and the basket stopped moving. They walked out and into a dim-lit hallway, with scrunched up metal doors and caution tape strung across the ceiling. Demse led them into a room, where a capsule sat in the centre and kids in tattered lab cloaks checked monitors repeatedly. Cold, wet steam billowed out from jet hidden under a pad situated around the capsule. “In there’s my brother, Wilkins.” They all stared in complete awe, jaws touching the dirt floor. “Yep,” he repeated, nodding.
Demse ushered them to a monitor centred a lumpy, jelly-like structure. “That’s his brain activity, according to the CLARITY scan.” He referred to a diagram of brain activity. Certain areas of the scan were fluctuating red and near purple. The heart diagram was pumping like a machine gun, and the adrenal glands were dumping their respective chemicals at a very efficient pace. There was a loud chime, and a voice came on the P.A: “EXIT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER. EXIT CONTAINMENT CHAMBER.” everybody filed out like robots, and Jasmine had to grip Darrell’s shoulder as she watched her best friend emerge from a the machine like he was the holy grail, wrapped in a chrysalis. She let her jaw sink into the soil of the ground. “Awesome. Can I go next?”


Jasmine and Darrell went over to Wilkins, who had fair, brown hair and was wearing a robe. “Not the best way I would want to night one, but-so be it.” He handed each one a pellet. “That is the final test. Ingest it.” Darrell looked around. “Come on. Ingest it.” Everybody watched. Darrell took it, studied it, and tossed it into his mouth.
The first thing he noticed was that it was not a pellet. Maybe plastic, but definitely not a pellet. He gagged, was about of cough it up a rush of air caught him and he swallowed it down further. He powered through, and, after a minute and a half of brutal force, he exhaled. “There.” Jasmine looked, goggle eyed, and noticed a drinking fountain nearby. She walked over, grabbed a cup, poured herself water and dropped the pill inside, where it dissolved promptly. She drank down the water and was met by the sour taste of granny porridge. “Ack!” She cried. Wilkins smiled. Maybe 5 seconds past. “You two, come with me.”
They were led into a room with japanese art: blooming cherry blossoms, done on rice paper with a fountain pen, a beautiful fan stretching the length of the room, and soft, plushy cushions that Wilkins laid out for them. “Do you know what that was for?” He asked the question with the ghost of a smile, looking at either. They shook their heads. “That was to see what your approach to a problem is.
“The brave, enduring one will swallow the pill whole.” He mimed a choking rabbit, gagging and coughing like one would. “The clever, cautious one is you, Jasmine.” Again, he acted out the scene and went back to talking. “Others have crushed the pill with the cup, which I call the ‘FizzleBert stump method.’”
“What did you do?” asked Jasmine, curious.
“I rubbed the pill between my fingers,” Wilkins mimed churning the pill with his index and thumb, “Until it was smooth and chewy. Dunno how I did that one, though.” He smiled nicely and tentatively to both of his pupils.


“Enough talk,” he said, “You two are officially in the Syndicate. And Darrell, stop drooping your jaw-it’s embarrassing.”


## Two years later


### Darrell-P.W


Darrell folded the last touch to his paper plane, then tossed it underhand. It soared under three table legs in a smooth glide before another boy put his warm hand under the plane to raise it to his desk. The other boy unfolded the plane and read the note:
Sale behind P.W. Mr. Hardie, spotless truffles. Sleep pill.
The ‘other boy’, James, wrote back:
Where:
He then folded up the paper plane and tossed it in a high arc so it landed at the edge of the lamp. James’ friend, Wilkins, had calculated the trajectory angles for him and had a cheat sheet on how much time would pass before heat and gravity tipped the plane to the receiver. In this case, Darrell’s message would come in roughly 20 seconds.


The teacher, Mr. Lamb, turned his back to face the smartboard. The plane tipped slightly before sliding off the overhead lamp and landing in Darrell’s muscled lap. He, despite his bulky appearance and shaven-to-the-skull-head, grasped the pen delicately and wrote back:
Where: Sleep pill, Hardie’s classroom: room 208
Mr. Lamb was lecturing the class about spin, the quantum effect, but several kids weren’t listening. Sure, they were taking some notes, but really, they were operating under the world’s most recent syndicate. Nobody knew about them, and no one would have suspected them in the form of high school students. It seemed like a retard’s idea, but it was fool-proof. Or, “retard-proof.”
When you live in the year 2021, a syndicate is equal to a terrorist group, but this high school ‘project’ was like a think tank, where the nation’s most ambitious kids gathered to make life-changing inventions, or just experiment with tricks. Some F- kids were now getting C+s due to the syndicate, which was due to their daily lectures, based off of new advancements in technology and innovation. The syndicate had no name.
But it was to be, a nationwide syndicate.

### Wilkins-Point Grey


11:23. Wilkins, fair brown hair with spotless skin, felt the bottom of his desk. Underneath was a Blackberry Passport, stuck on with a wad of sticky gum, set to texting. It was practically all he did with it. Wilkins tapped at the keyboard to send his text, pretending to keep notes from the top of the desk. He had memorized the positions of the keys on the qwerty keyboard, needless to say. His desk had a complicated layout. From the top, yes, he was pretending to keep notes, but below his desk was the Blackberry Passport. Under his rightmost chair cuff was a Makey-Makey Go, which had been programmed to send the text when he hit it with his heel.two wires ran up the chair leg and to a microcomputer, which was hidden behind the rim of his chair. All his textbooks were cover-ups for the back of his desk, which housed all his miniature PaperChips, miniature robots that worked via static charge.


Ms. Corey picked up her fallen textbook and flipped to the correct page, mumbling about as she did. Wilkins used that time to his advantage. He hit the back of his chair leg to send the text, which would have normally rewarded him with a trip to the office and 5 days after school of writing “I will not bang my chair leg” 500 times, but right now, Ms. Corey was too busy finding her page for the lesson to even notice. Wilkins also had to rely on Darrell’s quick thinking to avoid detention for a ringing phone.

### Darrell-P.W


Feeling a little vibration on his arm, Darrell pressed his hand to his smartwatch. Carefully, he glanced down, to find a warning:
20 seconds till message ringtone.
Darrell had to act fast. On impulse, he raised his hand. Mr. Lamb turned to the smartboard just as he did. No, thought Darrell. Mr. Lamb was still writing. Darrell glanced at his watch. 16 seconds. Mr. Lamb turned back to face the class and answered Darrell. “Can I go to the washroom?” Mr. Lamb sighed and turned away in disappointment. As he did, Darrell snuck a peek at his wrist. 11 seconds. Darrell couldn’t go to the washroom to check the message, so he would have to muffle the noise. But how? Darrell looked back at the art area, where there was a bathroom. One with a water fountain. Bingo, he thought. 10 seconds.
“No, you can’t, Mr. Tsamis. You’ll miss the lesson.” explained Mr. Lamb. Darrell was desperate. 7 seconds. “Can I go for a drink?” Mr. Lamb nodded ever so slightly, as if his neck was made of thin rubber.
2 seconds. Darrell shuffled to the back of the classroom quickly. 1 second. He felt his pockets. Oh no, thought Darrell. 0 seconds. The phone was in his desk. Darrell braced and lunged for the water fountain as the phone rang.
There was a loud brang brang! and Mr Lamb turned to face the class. He was stroking his chin and narrowing his eyes down to whoever looked suspicious, finally stopping at Tanya Liu.


Tanya was biting her nails and quivering minimally, trying to look guilty. She was, after all, the dummy-woman of all her sector’s operations, and the bail-outer of the classroom. There was one bail-outer in every operational classroom, and bugs and cameras set in non-operational ones.
Mr. Lamb fixed his eyes on Tanya’s. “Why didn’t you turn off your cell phone?” Tanya quivered. “B-because I-I-I forgot...” Mr. Lamb didn’t seem convinced.
“To the office. Now.”

### Jasmine-Shalhevet


It was lunch. And Jasmine had a job to do.


After all, Wilkins did need another twenty centimeter bronze coil. The only place to find them? Shalhevet. Where exactly? The science room.


Rushing against the huge current of gossiping girls, Jasmine ducked under the flyers table and examined the vent. She knew that this was the one that lead to the science room, but what size screwdriver would be needed? Jasmine fished around her pockets for a penny, her hands appearing back out empty handed. Dang it, she thought. The girls were nearly all filed out of their classrooms. Jasmine fished around in her left pocket and also, came out empty handed. Everybody had filed out. And Mr. Wu, the strictest teacher in the school, had just come out of his classroom.
Jasmine straightened up and ducked out of the flyers table.Mr. Wu fixed his eyes on Jasmine, eyeballs rolling seamlessly in their sockets like sentry turrets. His lower eyelids rose up, as if they were on hydraulic lifts. He could have been a robot. Gracefully, Jasmine whipped her hair around and turned her back to Mr. Wu. He, in his school uniform and gelled black hair, looked like a character from DragonBall, with snake-slit eyes, hair clumped like it was manga-drawn, and a gaze so strong, it literally took the truth out of the victim’s mind. Luckily, Jasmine never felt like it would affect her
Mr. Wu swallowed back a look of annoyance, clearly insulted by the straight, cold eyes that Jasmine had given him like an April Fools joke. He spoke with a thick chinese accent, embedded by cold, dark syllables and piercing tone. His height was like that of a gnome, barely reaching Jasmine’s.
“Ms. Yu.” Jasmine whirled around and tilted her head sideways.
“What?” Mr. Wu’s face showed no emotion, only a dread and coldness. “Why,” he began, “Were you snooping around under the flyers table? Perhaps, say, to get into the science room to steal a bronze coil?” Jasmine responded with her backup plan. She was always puzzled at how Mr. Wu had always managed to “guess” the correct motive of a student. “I’m not sure I understand what you meant, Mr. Wu.” He managed the ghost of a smile. “Ah, you know what I mean,” he pressed back, knowing exactly what Jasmine was going to say, “Exactly what I mean.” His cold stare was up and ready to fire, and it was up to Jasmine to stop it. She raised her counter stare up to Mr. Wu’s line of sight, and enlarged her eyes, making a slight tilt in the process. He broke the stare, then came back with his stony glare, raising no warning as to what he was going to do. Mr Wu narrowed his eyes down to Jasmine’s.


“I know exactly what you were doing,” Wu pressed on, taking his stare to the next level. Jasmine gulped, then pointed her eyeballs to the floor, where a teacher had dropped her notes. By some scheme of events, she happened to be Ms. Khader, who Everyone knew Mr. Wu had a major crush on. He was dating her now, which seemed like the happiest ending for someone like Mr. Wu. Khader had blonde hair, with a bit of freckles and acne. She was groovy, and probably the nicest and coolest teacher in Shalhevet. Every girl, luckily, was in her class at least once, as she was a grade 9-10 split, and the only grade 9 teacher (every other teacher knew that was the benchmark for puberty) in Shalhevet.


Mr. Wu rushed over to help Ms. Khader, trying to make a good impression on her.
“Sorry about the books.”
“Nah, it’s okay. Oh-hey! Are we still arranged for Saturday night?”
“Yeah! Great!”
“Oh, yeah-so, La Crocodile?”
“Yeah!”
“Okay! See ya tomorrow!”
Mr. Wu whirled around to find Jasmine gone. Worst yet, he didn’t even know where she was. In front of him, or behind? He didn’t know. His only answer was the creak of the west entrance door, followed by a paper airplane that hit him in the head. Mr. Wu screamed in rage, Shattering the overhead lights. This wasn’t the only time the school had to repair the lights because of Jasmine.


A janitor was outside waiting for Mr. Wu, cleaning the walls of the school. He hadn’t seen him doing this job any time before, and had seen the janitor showing up coincidentally every time Jasmine made a run for it. The walls seemed clean enough already.
“Watcha doin’, Turner?” Mr. Wu frowned. “It’s Wu, Harold Wu, sir,” he said, his face stern and sweaty.
“Ya’ lookin’ for that dirty rascal-girl?” he laughed, answered by a hailfire of spit wads that seemed to have no assailant. The janitor laughed again, apparently ignoring Mr. Wu as he steamed in white hot rage.
“Yes, I am. Where did she go?” he said the words with the preciseness of a general. The janitor continued to wipe the walls.
“Well-oh!” The janitor pointed to the paper airplane that Mr. Wu was holding. He tossed it to him. “Sorry,” he said it apologetically, “I’m a paper airplane fanatic.” Mr. Wu felt puzzled. The last time he talked to this guy, he was into note-folding. Before that, pebbles. Other hobbies included plant collecting, totem collecting, paper collecting and keyboard-key collecting. The janitor was a strange guy.


Mr. Wu waited as the janitor unfolded the plane and studied every crease, measuring the thickness of it, the length of the fold and the technique used in throwing (which was evident in the plane’s irregularities and Mr. Wu’s forehead’s). Suddenly he was called over by a bamboozled janitor who had unfolded the plane completely. Inside was a scrawled out collection of letters reading:
Better check the science room for
the stolen bronze coil.
Mr. Wu dropped the paper and ran to the science room in a hurry.


Jasmine pressed on the vent with all her might, and the bars gave way in a satisfactory fashion. She turned to lie on her back and slipped down past the grate and into the science room. As she did, Jasmine grabbed the indent in the vent’s opening and slid her entire rest of body out of the ventilation shaft. There was a thump as she dropped down into the science room and began searching for the bronze coil. Jasmine couldn’t risk turning on the lights to search for the coil, so she had to look for it in the dark, sparring her hands everywhere in search of the bronze wire.


When you’re Jasmine Yu, you care only about caution. That sneaky girl had painted the door hinge in a low-viscosity liquid that expanded and dried in a matter of 2.53 seconds. She had also brought a night vision monocle stored in a fake lunchbox, along with screws and lock-pickers. Jasmine had produced the tube of quick-dry paint from a secret compartment in the third cabinet of the art room, one of the central hubs in Shalhevet. A central hub was a place stocked with supplies, located in various conspicuous classrooms around the school. If that wasn’t enough, she’d also put a tranq-dart clip at the edge of the door, so any person who passed it would get knocked out. Cold.


Jasmine checked her watch and cursed. 3 minutes left till the lunch bell rang. She was desperate. checking all the cabinets, Jasmine hadn’t realized that, on the windowsill lay a bronze coil, exactly the one Wilkins needed.


There was a thump on the door and Jasmine whirled around, only to greeted by a “Ms. Yu, I know you’re in there!” followed by another thump. Jasmine turned quickly, and incidentally, found the coil. She was also worried about the relenting paint that was going to be her demise. Jasmine estimated that in 5 seconds, Mr. Wu was going to break through the painted door and chew her out, most likely in the form of two week detention. She also estimated that it would take 3 seconds to run for the coil, and 4 seconds to climb through the vent and escape Mr. Wu’s anger management fit. What was she going to do?
































## Bond, James Bond

### Wilkins-Point Grey


If you asked him, Wilkins had a habit of being at the right place at the right time. Actually, to be more exact, his phone did.


He was getting up for the lunch bell when his phone vibrated in his pocket. Two short rumbles and a long, enduring one, thought Wilkins. He pulled out the phone and quickly, as the result of years of practise, executed a series of quick taps and ended up ringing Mr. Wu’s phone, done with a series of hotkeys that allowed him to hack anyone’s phone and toy around with it. He knew that in the science room, faced with the prospect of detention and anger management fits, Jasmine was breathing sighs of relief.
Jasmine-Shalhevet


Jasmine, as predicted, breathed a sigh of relief as she heard the harmonic tone of Mr. Wu’s phone ringing. He, outside, stopped banging on the door and stared down at his pocket, pulling his phone out as he did. Ms. Khader was calling. Clearing his voice, he accepted the call and responded as he would. A muffled flirt protruded from the other side of the door, and Jasmine thanked Wilkins for buying her a few minutes to escape. She snatched the bronze coil in a sweep and jumped for the ventilation shaft, then dropped down when she realized she’d left the screws and grate behind.


Mr. Wu’s muffled voice had an unmistakeable tone to it, and Jasmine quickly deciphered the sound to 3 words: “Okay, bye bye.” She swallowed thinking, I need to get out. So Jasmine tossed the grate up and into the vent, then put the screws in her pocket. 1, 2...she counted the screws as she picked them up...3...she was missing one. Oh well, she thought solemnly. Jasmine leapt and grabbed the edge of the vent, fitting herself up with her arm strength and motivation to avoid getting chewed out. The paint would make it’s last stand in moments...Jasmine rolled out and into the shaft...screwed the vent in...then realized she was missing something. The lunchbox! Oh no, she thought. Mr. Wu pushed through the door with all his strength and flew forward, landing just past the tranq-dart clip.
“Ms. Yu, I know you’re in there!” he yelled, running for the lunchbox. He was just about to pick it up when he heard the swish of a mop, just before he was knocked out by the janitor.
Jasmine smiled. The janitor pulled off his bald wig, revealing a russian boy with jet-black hair and a moustache that was also fake. He was Demse . The boy had been able to sneak out of P.W for the operation, being the bail-outer of his classroom. He did, after all, seem to have everyone’s backs.
James-P.W.
James, at the same time, was sneaking into the teacher’s lounge to drop a sleep pill into Mr. Hardie’s mug of coffee. The idea was, with Hardie asleep the entire afternoon, James’ class would ‘step up,’ and James and Darrell would sell the truffles, taking a small amount from each sale of truffle they made. The estimated total made on James’ behalf: $103.
He snuck past the last teachers and students and stood by the washroom, waiting for them to leave down the stairs. When such happened, he would pick the lock and drop a timed pill into the coffee machine. Then he would hide in an easily inconspicuous place and manually activate the pill, incapacitating Mr. Hardie. If such worked, James would get $103. Just like that.
With skillful fingers, James inspected the lock and smiled.
“So that’s how you want to play it, huh?” He grabbed a pocket knife out of his-well, pocket. The only difference that separated this knife from commercial ones was that it had been specially designed for him by a drug dealer living in the middle east. The pocket knife was fitted with a state of the art finger-sensitive grip special-fitted for James’ hand and handprints. His knife made use of a sliding mechanism and lcd display to increment special functions into it. Plus, the knife was designed for burglars, not wildlife specialists or survivalists (James had a knife that covered both needs).


James tapped a single incrementation on the knife, and a label slid up. Reading the label, he pulled the slit forward to reveal a lock pick. He then pushed the pick into the room’s lock, but not before a student spotted him while stepping out of the washroom. Quickly, James pulled on the lock pick, and it dislodged with a touch of force, sending him stumbling back into a door on the other end of the hallway. The door opened, and out stepped Mr. Hardie.


He was dressed in a t-shirt and bermuda shorts, with smooth, brown hair that was obviously natural and eyes that showed a sense of liveliness. Perhaps that was why he was smiling and smooth as he opened the door with a fast, quick reflex and hit james on the head. Both men staggered off with a look of surprise on their faces.
“What are you doing here?” they asked in unison. It was a few seconds before either realized what was going on.


“Hey,” Mr. Hardie stopped for a moment to think about who James was. He had to cut in to save Hardie from taking a millennia to think about it.
“James,” he responded, trying to be assertive. Mr. Hardie nodded. “Yeah, James, I was just about to say that.” Both laughed, and then with the dismissive wave of a hand, he continued. “I...was just going down to the teacher’s lounge for a meeting.” James had to fake it. “Me too,” he responded, trying to think of such a reason to do so,”Just to pick something up for the teacher.”
“Like what?” James stopped for a second. “Um...” he started, “Well...it’s a bit complicated.”


Mr. Hardie, being the neat-haired I-make-friends-all-the-time guy, didn’t stop for a beat before answering. “Come on, just tell me. I’ll understand!” The two walked into the teacher’s lounge and went for their respective places. While at it, James tried to start for the coffee machine. But his host stopped him. “Wow, wow. I thought you were looking for the thing you were going to give to the teacher.”
“Yeah! A cup of coffee!”
“But all of the teachers have gotten a cup already!”
James pretended to stumble upon the words. “W-wait-oh, sorry. I just got caught up on a thought.” Mr. Hardie, directed from the coffee machine and the cup of coffee, nodded in agreement. “Ah.”


James was in trouble. Had he known that the machine was on the opposite side of the file cabinet, he would not have asked for such an elaborate method. But his eagerness to dive into the ocean of syndicate was why he chose this. So he had to cope. He walked over to the file cabinet and remembered that Wilkins had history class in the room opposite of that wall. He casually then leaned over the cabinet and pulled open the cabinet. He didn’t know which places were central hubs or not, so he rummaged around, trying to find a slot of sorts. He came across nothing that seemed suspicious to him. What else?, he thought. Quickly, he pulled a file out and went off to the coffee machine on the other side of the room, grasping his keys in the process and twirling them downwards so the bike lock keys hung between his index and middle finger. As he went for it, Mr. Hardie stopped him. “Wow. You’re getting caught up again!” he chuckled. James laughed, too. His bike keys slipped off his fingers behind the coffee machine and, unknowingly, walked out the door.


About a minute passed and Mr. Hardie appeared outside with his keys. “You forgot these.”
“Where?” James shuffled through the doorway and bounded into the room, where several teachers were waiting patiently for the meeting to begin. The teacher pointed to behind the coffee machine. “Over there.” James looked behind the machine and gasped. “There!?” while at it, he slid sideways and knocked the coffee machine open. A teacher, Ms. Demirez, pointed at the lid and yelled, “Hey!” James looked at the inside of the coffee machine, filled to the top with coffee powder. “Wow,” James marveled at the ergonomic design. “Cool. Sweet build.” He looked behind the machine and brushed across the very top of the spread of coffee powder before closing the lid. He rushed outside with a nervous smile.


It was the near end of the meeting. Mr. Hardie took a sip from his cup. Everyone remained silent.
“Well, everybody, I hope that concludes the discussion about the inappropriate books being housed in the library.” The teacher speaking, Mrs. Ancqualov, spoke with a hellish monkey voice that seemed to rattle the cupboards open.“Actions will begin next term, during spring break.”
While the teachers filed out through the door, Mr. Hardie suddenly felt a groggy sensation weighing him down. He blinked for a moment, staggered and stumbled into the last teacher shuffling through the door, Ms. Demirez. “You okay?” she asked, clearly puzzled.
“Y-yeah...” he stumbled back and grabbed the first chair in sight, which was about to tip. “Of-”


He never remembered hitting the ground.





There was a satisfaction welling up inside James as he walked into his classroom and sat down.
Everything was simple and straight forwards. He’d easily managed to get his bike keys behind the machine, and find the excuse to look back there, bump the lid of the coffee machine open and “brushed” his hand over the coffee powder, which obviously was how he got the pill in.


Mission successful, he thought.
### Wilkins-abandoned factory


Wilkins stopped at the end of the factory, his hand wrapped around Jasmine’s. The dark, dank feeling embraced everything around them, dawning a cold feeling on either one. Wilkins stared at the wall and punched it to reveal a hidden slot.The ground beneath them gave way, leaving them standing on a single cement plate. Behind them lay a series of stairs that lead down to syndicate headquarters. The cement plate started sliding, and they were sent bumping down the stairs and into a dark room, musty and cold. The dusty scene filled Jasmine’s eyes, giving her the urge to squeeze off Wilkins’ hand, while he cleared his throat and looked ahead. Jasmine shivered.
“Where is this?” she squeaked, stepping her foot back into a box of cobwebs. She shrieked, then kicked the box forwards and into the wreckage of old computer parts. A flickering holographic screen shot out, and it displayed a jump-scare that sent Jasmine tripping over another box and into a dusty, moth-eaten hammock. Wilkins laughed.


“It’s...uh...one of the new headquarters.” Jasmine screamed again. “What!?!?!?” Wilkins was starting to feel a little hilarity in the fact that Jasmine was so freaked. After all, she could take out a person’s lungs with her bare hands, but couldn’t stand up to a box of cobwebs? He presumed this ironic. Jasmine, though, thought this wasn’t so ironic to her, since cobwebs were usually a sign a something sinister and scary, whereas ripping one’s lungs out could signal empathy. “Y’know,” she had, a few months ago, said, “Like the fact that you might have had a breathless moment in your life.”


Wilkins cleared his throat and spoke ahead into the wreckage of machinery.
“Alpha tango zulu three four eight tango tango papa bravo.”
The wreckage started to shift, pulling apart like sliding glass doors to reveal a sleek, white room filled with caches and people. Every cache housed a different idea and innovation, except for a huge pad at the end of the room. Wilkins walked in and raised his hand, and everybody stopped, quieted, and turned to face him.
“Where,” he asked, “Is the off-roader that Henry designed?”
Everybody started to think. This went on for several minutes until one boy said, “Oh-Demse?...He’s...Oh right! He took a test-drive on Grouse.”
Henry-Grouse Mountain


The off-roader smashed through the lift and tumbled upside down, sliding down the mountain. Several parents shrieked and screamed for security as the car stopped lying in the snowbanks. The driver sighed and waited. The wheels slid down to touch the snow, and suddenly, the cockpit had flipped. He was back right-side up.


Five snowmobiles leapt over the edge of the cliff, Henry sped down the hill, all drivers followed in pursuit. He swerved and drove off the cliff, landed in the snowbanks. Every snowmobile taking a narrow path off the cliff to follow. He raced down the hill. Sleet flew in all directions, clouding up the view. He twisted and turned, a glimpse of black in his left mirror...and there was a dash of a ski blade slashing at the side of his jeep/car as a snowmobile veered off to prevent collision. Henry slammed the brakes. The car turned. He careened down the steep off limits run backwards, looking in his central mirror for steering.


Suddenly, two snowmobiles converged and slammed on the sides of his off-roader, and one of the drivers leapt into his back trunk hood. Henry unbuckled, leapt for the man. Pushed him off. A yell. A screech. The snowmobile directly behind him exploded in the foggy hail. The other snowmobile driver leapt onto his driver’s seat and threw his mug at him. It slammed against his fingers and he nearly flew off. No way he was going to. He was pressed against the back, now the front of the car, while a man that never before operated it tried to steer out of oblivion.


The off-roader converged into a tree trail. Both men were screaming. Henry leapt forward, Grabbed past the steering wheel. His opponent turned, tried to slam him into a tree. Henry leaned, flipped into the car, missing it. The back end of the car turned sideways. Both combatants were flung off the off-roader. Like a chain, Henry was unfortunate to grab onto the driver’s foot while he latched on one of the hood bars. The car was veering and swerving sideways. A deep groove led it through twisty gapes and finally raced out of the tree trail and into a snowmobile that had parked at the side. The driver, who had previously followed in pursuit, sprung off to the side as there was a huge explosion, and a tumbling ball of Henry rolled off and into a tree.


It was all Sam could think about as he skied down the slope to the explosion. He needed to interrogate him, maybe get a few hundred dollars in the process. How hard was it? A few questions, and he would be in and out.
He met the patrol workers carrying Henry in a stretcher. Henry sat up abruptly and throbbed his head. “Owww...” he muttered, looking around. With a quick flash, he bounced backwards on the stretcher and flipped off, kicking two unfortunate workers in the process. He then  pushed the stretcher forwards and knocked all four out quickly. No one to mindwipe, he thought. Then he dropped to the ground with no recollection of what had just happened.
Wilkins-syndicate laboratory


Jasmine just stared at the small watermelon in amazement.
“A shrapnel bomb?” she asked. Wilkins nodded in enthusiasm. “Yep, exactly!” he was filled with heartfelt excitement as he connected the final coil to the hollow watermelon and rigged it up to a car battery, then, when done, chuckled in excitement. “Hehee,” he giggled, leading Jasmine into another room.


The room was plain, except for several desks and a large, wide window that looked into the previous watermelon-inhabited room. Wilkins closed the door.
“And...” he pressed a button on his button-down lapel, and there was a deafening bang as bits of watermelon shrapnel smashed at the windows and walls, denting them cleanly and cracking the big, panorama window. Jasmine was awestruck.
“Awesome,” she muttered under her breath. Wilkins was about to show her another, non-hollowed watermelon when his phone rang.
“Yes?”
“Henry. I’ve been spotted.” Wilkins considered this line for a moment. Spotted? Well, after all, he was doing training runs on grouse, a popular ski area in Vancouver, but spotted? Wilkins had never budged, as the co-chair of the directors board of the syndicate, to think of what to do if they were discovered. What to do? He had to give his best shot at it.
“How were you discovered?”
“I swear, one of the skiers on the lift, Sam-” Wilkins cut him off quickly and considered how to eliminate and stop Sam from giving away the syndicate’s identity. What he said didn’t quite match up with what he was thinking.
“How do you know?”


There was a long, drooping silence as Henry sat, chained to a chair, interrogated by the science club of P.W. He was considering his options as a group of boys and girls, thirteen of them to be exact, circled him and waited for him to hang up. He had been put on a word limit of 35 words. He had 21 words left.
“I’m being interrog-” Henry felt his vision go black for a second as one of the members gave a blow to his stomach.
“What?” asked Wilkins. He heard a muffled voice saying, “That’s 18 words,” followed by a yell, and a “17.” Henry was on a word limit. Wilkins didn’t have a way to stop it.
“Where are you?” Wilkins was mumbling words and locations into the phone, so that the science group wasn’t able to hear him. Eventually, Henry stopped Wilkins when he whispered in, “school club room.”


Wilkins stopped, then turned to Jasmine, who had heard the entire conversation and was expanding her eyes past the size of soccer balls.
“Get Shaun, and tell him to get Henry out of the school. Fast.”























## Just Getting Inside


### Shaun-training lab


Two men in staffs closed in on him. Hands in a defensive position, Shaun pressed his weight forwards and leapt, performing a split kick on both men. They both blocked, then dropped their bodies low as he landed. Shaun shuffled back and spun a kick, then shuffled forwards again. The man blocked both hits, then ducked to attempt a trip. Shaun leapt up and performed a round house, then dropped a stomp kick to send the other man sprawling across the plexiglass floor. Both men were lying down with praise for Shaun when Jasmine showed up with her “something serious” glasses (glasses that revealed the word “something serious” when unfolded).


“What?” asked Shaun, attentive and listening. Jasmine’s eyes were narrow. “Science room,” she responded, “P.W.”
Henry-science room


As he was strapped to the chair, Sam smiled.
“You’re done, right?” Henry nodded. “Yes...” Without missing a beat,  Sam jumped up and trotted around Henry.
“Well-oh!” he yelled,  swinging his arms in the air and gesturing for a wooden oak stick, “Let’s answer a few questions, shall we?” Henry shook his head. Sam, with the wooden stick in his hand, threw his arms forward and whacked his legs, snapping the chair leg and breaking his left leg just below the knee. “ARE WE?”
Henry finally nodded. He felt a searing pain crawl up his legs as he struggled and writhed on the floor, cut with wooden splinters. He didn’t care, though. For all he could remember, the science room might have been a central hub positioned in the school, but then again, it wasn’t very far-fetched for something like that to happen.


Sam struck his first question, but not before spitting out the ground rules.
“10 words,” he said, “And, actually, since I’m going to be extra mean to you, 5 words. Everything you say counts.” Henry swallowed. Sam continued on to the first question.
“What was the intention of the driving of the off-roader?” Henry shook his head. “I’m afraid I don’t understand what you imply, sir.” Sam punched him in the stomach. “Too many words, boy.” Henry spat a winkle of spit at Sam. It landed in between his eyes, the result being a scream and a riot as Sam raced for the towels in a science fair experiment and wiped himself clean. “Yeah,” he muttered as he finished wiping the spot clean, “We can just put it back when we’re done with the towel-” a boy from the thirteen kids spoke. “Well, the condition of the towel will ch-” Sam cut him off. “Ah, whatever.”


You see, Sam looked and acted exactly like a non-geek. But his business of being able to forge science experiments from other groups earned him A’s in science, and therefore earned a reputation as a geek. He, really, in general, was not a geek. Just one big “self-important son of a something,” as Henry might say. He had a very spoilt background and was scrawny, but tall and fierce and calm. A freckled face speckled him, and he had brown, gelled hair with a permanently innocent look that was his record too, according to the government. But chaining and locking someone up to interrogate them was not very innocent, or scientific, if I had a say in this.


One of the boys stepped forward on Sam’s command. He was muscled, with hair that glinted grey in the light. The boy had a crooked smile and his left eye was nearly closed, with pale purple skin around it. You could see little tints of metal in between his teeth, and they flashed a blinding light in Henry’s eyes as the boy leaned to inspect him.
“That’s Conner,” explained Sam, “I kinda, sorta made him this way in an accident, but don’t judge him. He has a gut feeling about movement like it’s one of his senses.” Henry swallowed. “Isn’t that nice. Locked in a room with thirteen freaks and one of them is a science experiment.” His only response was a blindingly fast kick from Conner, which sent more chair bits flying and had him basically gagged on the floor and helpless.
At that moment, there was a clattering sound from  the duct above him. Someone had removed the grate from the other side of the vent. Henry felt hope, then also felt it wash away as Sam ordered one of the thirteen kids to stop the someone climbing through the vent. He could only hope that the rescuer was a martial arts master and had very good social interaction. Not a second later, there was the sound of a door opening and closing. There were more coming! Just again, there was a clatter of a vent. Sam was getting very worried.
“Haley, west entrance! Celia, duct in main hall!” He frantically called out orders until his lungs seared from such a consistency. It was also when he was one of the last 4 kids in the room. It was the first time in hours that Henry had laughed. Sam silently cursed himself for letting his guard down.


Shaun, meanwhile, was crawling back through the duct after literally single-handedly incapacitating one of the thirteen kids that were positioned throughout the school. He, as so, was squirming through the duct, despite his skinny build, and had neared the end of the duct. The walls closed on him, and he could barely fit in the space. It was pitch black. He didn’t know where up was. Shaun squeezed his arms around and felt the duct’s walls while he pushed through it like an inchworm. His lungs felt like cement, he might die in here, and worst of, this was just for trying to save Henry.


To explain this, Shaun was the only kid in the operation. All of the shutting doors, Wilkins. He would jump in if there was a real emergency, but Shaun should have been able to handle it. Shaun would press the button in his pant leg to signal Wilkins if he was caught. Then again, he couldn’t do it because his arms were in front of him, not behind, as he tried to crawl through the ventilation shaft and rescue Henry.


Wilkins paced back and forth outside the school, fiddling with the keys that he had in his hands. They were from the janitor, which he had to slyfully pickpocket to get his hands on. He was not receiving a signal from Shaun. That’s good, he thought. Until he was yanked off his feet and onto the cement ground. WIlkins wheezed a breath out of his lungs, clearly winded. It was the last breath he had before the pain erupted all around him, and he passed out. Meanwhile, Shaun might have been breathing his last breaths.


He squeezed through the vents, sweaty and exhausted. Where was that darn pipe? He felt hot and dehydrated.  A searing heat cut through his skin, everything stung, he couldn’t see-why today?, he thought. These kinds of thoughts streamed through his head-My lungs are shriveling into raisins right now, God oh god, let’s go back, Please not, I’m too young to die, so just...you get it. But, with a grimace, he pushed those aside. “No,” he muttered, “Just ignore the pain.” Maybe that was his lucky day. Maybe not. Because right then, he felt the bars of a grate. And a dim light farther ahead.


The light was enough to light up the chamber, and Shaun felt some hope. He started squeezing ahead.


A long time after, Shaun was about to climb through the grate. He had a penny in his sleeve pocket that he was going to use to unscrew the vent, and was perched and ready. Shaun tapped his penny on the first screw he was going to unscrew. No sound. Weird, he thought. He decided to see if the vent was loose. Raising his arms as high as he could, Shaun slammed them on the grate. No resistance. He just flew, straight through the hole and into the science room.


Shaun didn’t know that the grate was a holographic projection, and that if he’d looked in the bottom right corner of the grate, he’d have seen the faintest flicker of light that warned him of the holographic fake. But no person will check the four corners of a grate as a precaution, and Sam knew that all too well


He landed in a brightly lit room, bare of people. Only a muscular boy that looked like frankenstein, two kids that were identical and that weird boy, Sam, who was holding him upside down by a claw. Locked in a scary room of scary people, he decided to question.
“Why am I here?” he demanded lightly. Sam’s answer was deliberate and to the point. “Well,” he replied, “Because you know information that will ultimately lead to a high scale court trial, and I’m here to stop it.” Shaun asked another one. “Well why the heck are you doing this?”
“A new syndicate has evolved. I suspect it’s you little dirty freaks.” he stopped to let his questioner burn it in. “Why so?” Sam stopped for a moment. Which let out time for Shaun to punch Sam in the stomach and twist himself free from the claw.


The three other boys raced in to contain the loose Shaun. He rolled forward and dodged Frankenstein’s burly arm, then kicked at one of the twins in the stomach. The second twin blocked the incoming punch, both sent sprawling across the floor, and Frankenstein unleashed a combination of wushu and aikido that Shaun blocked, barely. It was then that he noticed Wilkins and Henry, lying on the floor. Frankie threw a punch, Shaun blocked it, his opponent threw his legs up to perform a drop kick. He leapt back, kicked the door as someone tried to open it, and boosted off to attack Frankie. A swinging punch that Frankie raised his hand up to block, two stomp kicks that he stood at ease for-his opponent was invincible.
Wilkins understood what he meant by “accident.” He could obviously presume that Frankie’s immune system was much more resilient than that of the normal human, and that his tissue cells degenerated and regenerated, the latter maybe at a faster rate, so cells were constantly being replaced. After a brief moment of calculation, Wilkins considered the odds. His cells regenerated at a ratio of, say, 7:1 : for every cell that died, a new one came to replace in 7 microseconds. That meant that his cells replaced 1,000 times faster than the average human. So, thought Wilkins, defeat is not an option for him. What he did know was that he was the smartest and most inventive kid in the world. And just then he realized that he was wearing his jacket.





















The Great Escape

Wilkins-P.W


Wilkins had to formulate a plan. But how? Well, he was good at physics, and he did study Rube Goldberg, the famous pulitzer prize winner. That’s it, he thought. I’m good at physics. But how to escape? Shaun glanced down, so he knows I’m here and probably doesn’t want to hurt me. If I get to a certain position he won’t try to step on me. Wilkins sought to improvise from there.


He wriggled from his spot and finally rolled up to the battlefield, where Frankie and Shaun were fighting. It was an epic fight, somewhat like a cross between The Matrix and Legend of the Drunken Master. And Shaun was like Jackie Chan. Wilkins looked around. Nothing. The tables were turned over and flipped. But he did spot a box cutter lying next to an unconscious Sam, nesting in the corner. Without blinking, he tumbled over to the side of the room, across the battlefield, and found Frankie sailing over him and slamming into the door, where a boy was trying to open it. A couple seconds later, Wilkins had the box cutter in his hand and was slowly but surely, cutting the half-a-foot-thick rope.


Shaun was using the door to his advantage. Pinning Frankie to the door, he repeatedly whacked and sparred at him until his opponent was completely knocked out cold and slumped against the door like a stopper.
Minutes past while Wilkins slashed through the ropes and cut Henry free. He had a broken leg in one place, so to speak. Arms slung over both shoulders, he limped in the other uninjured leg while Wilkins and Shaun supported him. They all trudged towards the door where Frankie lay.
Suddenly, the door came free, and the 9 kids that had been at their posts where met by frankie, barring the door and looking down at them. The nearest one, Jerry, skipped back. “Wow.” While his face was turned down, he heard a stern “Back to posts. Before someone seizes the chance to break in!” Everybody filed away quickly. When no one was in sight, Frankie toppled down with a smash and Wilkins ran forwards, carrying Henry.


They ran towards the wall opposite of the open science room door and Shaun tossed a grappling hook towards the strut above him. Wilkins checked his jacket. It was a brown leather one with a few features Wilkins loved to use.
A small remote was hidden in a fake inner pocket. He removed it and pressed a button labeled ‘arms.’ There was a little cough, and a pair of hollow arms with loads of wires emerged from the back of the jacket. That sound alerted the science room members, who rushed back to their sanctuary, only to find a battered Connor and three boys scaling the walls.


Wilkins took another controller out of his left pocket, then pulled a sleeve over the right remote and flipped it over. Two joysticks, ready to use.
On command, the two robotic arms moved up swiftly and grappled into the wall. Then, both arms clambered up and grabbed onto the struts, where Shaun was waiting for the two.
The science room cult returned outside with a hot potato cannon, firing out searing projectiles while the trio balanced on the strut, making their way across to the window. Wilkins was rummaging around in his pocket, and finally, grabbed a small packet that was swept aside by a hot potato that burned his hands. Stumbling, he dropped off the strut and was caught upside down by the indent lying in it. Wilkins felt his leg burn as he held on, while a flaming projectile scorched his pant leg and burned his skin. Barely holding on, Wilkins threw his hands up for a grab, when a volley of potatoes notched him in in the butt and sent him flying onto the strut. He dashed, ignoring his burns, to the other end of the strut and lept out the window with both friends, plummeting into the bushes.


wilkins pulled a strap on his outer pocket, and a huge balloon inflated and trudged along at a snail’s pace while the sounds of screaming and potato-fire were heard in the distance.


Sam turned back to his followers. “Well, that was a failed plan. But we have just enough evidence to reveal the syndicate for good. And that few hundred dollars will be split between all of us.”


As the trio bloated along like a tortoise in the air, Wilkins explained the plan.
“Alright guys,” he started, “Send a text to all members. We’re going to be locked in a turf war.”
“Why not just let it settle?” Shaun didn’t like the idea of ‘war.’ “How do you know that Sam isn’t just going to ‘let it go?’”
“Because I know Sam like you know how an egg turns out: I can predict what he’ll wear tomorrow. And I know he’s not the sort of person that’s going to loosen up from this experience. And he’s probably working for someone, that’s for sure.”
Wilkins lived in the vancouver house, on the 41st floor, room 1208. It was a classy penthouse, the dream house of any architect. As far as he was concerned, wilkins loved the place, and would never move for as long as he lived.
When you’re a mother and your son, along with two other boys, lands at the front of your penthouse at 3 in the morning in the morning, it’s never good.
The first chime of the doorbell and knocking of the door stung Ms. Henwinson awake. She rolled out of bed clumsily, and, with her vision obscured, stumbled down the moonlit stairs. She rubbed her eyes as she reached the bottom and saw clearly into the darkness. Her son, Wilkins, had gone for a walk, and hadn’t returned since, leaving her worried sick. Ms. Henwinson shuffled to the door and clicked the chain lock open, creaking the door open to find his son, bruised and battered, with a boy that was limping and another one with a long face and skinny build. She burst into tears. “Wilkins!” she sobbed, crushing her son in a bear hug. Wilkins pulled free. “Yeah,” he muttered, “Henry tripped. His leg’s broken. We had to carry him home.” Her sobbing turned into anger. “I’ve been searching for you for hours! Why didn’t you phone the police?” Wilkins turned away. “I have to carry a boy all the way here. Do you think I have time to call an ambulance or police!?” His father hustled down the stairs and yawned. “I think mother’s right. You should have called the ambulance.”
“I didn’t have time!”
“No excuses. To your room!” Wilkins groaned in frustration. “What is this, kids don’t have a say? I have no hands or feet to call the ambulance and carry someone-”
“To. Your. ROOM!”


Wilkins lay on his bed, moonlight spilling onto his chest. His  left foot constantly stamped on the mattress in frustration while he solved, again and again, a switch cube, which consisted of a locking mechanism that stopped one from turning in a certain direction. Every then and there he got up and muttered, “Why the hell don’t they get my point? Common sense.” His parents had grounded him with such harshness that he couldn’t even go to school. Day and night he sat there about. Then, one day, he got a call from Darrell.


He trudged about to his locker, thinking about why he hadn’t seen Wilkins. He then remembered that his best friend had been grounded.
His fingers wheeled around as he dialed the combination on his lock into place. Just then as he opened the locker door, Sam bumped into him like a warthog and shuffled away into the current of students. Darrell’s shoulder had a note taped to it, which was what he realized as he stared at a picture of Diana Evanston, his girlfriend, who, upon a blast of irony, did not know that he worked in the syndicate. He, slowly and carefully, peeled off the note and read it:
See ya at the bar, Wilkins.
Upon the realization of whom it was directed to, Darrell pulled out his phone. Little did he know that class started in 5 minutes.


WIlkins rolled off the bed and grabbed his phone, jumping back onto the mattress to receive the call.
“You got a note,” Darrell heaved out the words like they were crates of elephants. WIlkins nodded.
“Read it aloud?”
“ ‘See ya at the bar, Wilkins.’ ”
“That all?” Darrell replied with a yes. Wilkins had thoughts bounding up to his immune system turret, which was hopelessly trying to shoot them down. He finally came up with a plan. “Come to my house at two forty. We’ve got work to do.”


Sitting in the principal’s office, Darrell snored quietly as he slept through his lecture. “You know, Mr. Antoniou, we’ve been through this many times-” He slumped forth in his chair as Chantell Diamens appeared at the door with a drinking straw in hand. “It’s a memory dart.” As any good rigger would suggest, a memory dart replaced a thought in the brain by barricading a neuron pathway and producing another lane that collapsed after a short period of time. Fool proof. Or, “retard-proof.”
If WIlkins was not made of skin and organics, he was like synthetic rubber. Flexible and virtually invincible. Nothing stopped him from doing what he wanted to do. Not even his parents.
Just like clockwork in the scheme of things, Wilkins tried to look from another point of view. Well, he thought, I did have Shaun. he could have held him. Or we could have set him down. All of a sudden, he was inching towards feeling better. Of course, he still had a job to do.


He knocked on his bedroom door and his mother responded by opening it. “Yes?” Wilkins had a glum look on his face. “Well...there was a mall across the street from the bar that just opened up, and you and Dad can go.” She smiled at the thought. “Okay! Do you want to come?” She stuffed the question up his ear canals with a cheery voice. She might as well have been a happy pixie as oppose to a mother. Wilkins gave a sympathetic ghost of a smile and laughed. “But I’m grounded!”
“Does that mean that you can’t come?”
“Uh...I guess...” His mother’s smile grew larger and more plastic. “Okay. We’ll go alone!” She slammed the door and skipped down the stairs, Wilkins plugging his ears at the thumping and creaking of the floorboards under her weight.


Darrell got off his bike and slipped into the bushes as Mr. and Ms. Henwinson stepped out of their condo, slipped into their tesla, and drove away for the border. He stumbled out of them, ran to the front door, and buzzed for Wilkins. After a brief conversation, Darrell opened the door and ran for the elevator, remembering the bike he’d left in the bike rack.




























Funhouse Parties

Darrell-41st floor
The 41st floor was a 15 second ride, room 1028, a 12 second walk, and the front door, an oral and retical scan to which Wilkins let him in. “So,” Darrell asked, “How do we do this?” WIlkins got up. “I’ll call Jasmine, and we’ve got a team down.” He walked over, called briefly for Jasmine and was promptly met by the ecstatic girl. “What’s the plan?” He gestured for them to go down and outside the building.
Outside, Wilkins explained the plan. He himself noticed a loophole: getting past the border. Darrell pointed it out. “How do we get past the border?” Wilkins remembered. “Don’t worry. I’ve got it covered.”


Harold Wu was just enjoying his day with Ms. Khader when the boy ran up to him. Skinny build, cropped brown hair, and an apologetic grin was what he wore when he bumped into his girlfriend, ultimately spilling her groceries.
“Oh-uh... sorry!” She smiled empathetically and said, “Y’know, that’s not the only time someone has accidentally bumped into me. Just notice where you’re going next time, and be a little careful.” the boy stood up and stumbled, brushing against Mr. Wu’s coat minutely. His face didn’t change. “We know you did that on purpose-” Ms. Khader interrupted him “Well I don’t know! And besides, he’s a kid. and he looks like a kid that’s going to be in my class next year...” Suddenly, Mr. Wu felt a little weight coming off of him. Metaphorically, or literally? he wondered.
There was something strange about the boy. Maybe the fact that he held a flattened up helmet in one hand, or the fact that his clothes looked a tad bit bulkier- he didn’t know. But there was another thing about the boy. His belt. The inert appearance of strength that it portrayed. The fact that it was turned around the wrong way. Mr. Wu could add two and two together as he glimpsed the edge of a rope trailing out of his rusty pickup. He gasped. “You-” He was met by a blurry flash of brown and button-down as he lunged for the boy’s necktie.
Wilkins enjoyed the feeling of outsmarting his cruel 8th grade politics teacher. It was fun. But he smelled trouble in the air.
Trouble is the spicy scent that your nose is balancing on the edge of as it tries to comprehend it’s existence. It lingers at the very edge of your olfactory sensors like an object might at the edge of your peripheral vision. To Wilkins, it smelled of roasted bacon and Dentyne: Fire gum.


with all his strength, he pulled himself up onto the back of the pickup truck, where the trunk lay. Darrell was waiting for him. He laughed. “Dude, I took a picture of Mr. Wu’s face,” Darrell said, holding up a lytro camera so that Wilkins could see, “It was hilarious!” his friend wasn’t settled. There was something strange about the series of events. His hand wiping across his mouth as he yelled “You-”. The tight reach around the long span of his belt as he tried to grab the rope. An imminent tick as he failed to succeed his objective.
“God's not,” muttered Wilkins.


For a clever and inventive person, Wilkins hadn’t gone far in designing his simplest safety measure.
On the side of his belt, Wilkins had glued two small cigarette lighters together and, again, glued them to his belt. The cartridges had been refitted with greek fire solvent, which would eat through just about anything within a matter of seconds. He loved the idea-a quick last minute grenade in the nick of time. And just like one, he had installed a pin.
You probably have figured it out by now: the pin had been pulled by someone. Who exactly? Mr. Wu, theoretically.


As the politics teacher had cried out, he’d dribbled saliva on his knuckle. Reaching around for the rope, the knuckle came subject to inertia, pulling the pin out from the lighters. Wilkins barely noticed this as he turned round to check his belt.
“God oh god!” yelled Darrell, glancing around, panicky, “What in the world happened to it!” Wilkins had only ten seconds to do what he needed to do: find the pin. But they were too far from the supermarket, and even if they got there, Wilkins would be long gone. He guessed after his calculations of melancholy, that he had 8 seconds left. Another option: make his own pin. 7 seconds left. He dumped out a box lying in the trunk and shuffled around the contents of it. 5 seconds. He glanced a wound up bundle of wire and scissors next to it, picked the two up, and snipped off a length. 4 seconds. He wound it around and tried to flatten it, only succeeding in smoshing it further. 3 seconds. Another try at it, leaving 2 seconds. Another fail. He grabbed the entire bundle of wire and unraveled a piece, flattening out a few bends in that length. 1 second. He pushed it unsuccessfully into the pinhole. Too wide. Uh-oh, thought wilkins.


There was an explosion as the lighter head gave way and it was engulfed in flames. Wilkins had just enough time to toss the belt over the side before it incinerated a portion of the leather holster. Upon the realization of what would happen if he let it loose on the road, he lept and, belly over the railings, managed to catch the belt before it hit the road. The singed end of the belt let out some charred ashes that withered away on the asphalt road, harmless. As for the other end of the belt, that was a whole nother story.
When Wilkins tossed the belt over the trunk railings, a small, charred piece of leather was left at the edge of the trunk, smoking away, and now that Wilkins’ shirt had been left dangling down at the ashes, the withering flames would finally relive their tormentous seconds of destruction.


Only smoke warned Wilkins of the fire blazing on his shirt. It wafted upwards, choking him and forcing him to lie belly up. He hollered out like a howler monkey as it quickly incinerated his shirt. Wilkins pulled the remaining bunch of cotton he could save and shot putted it over to the other end of the trunk, where it slowly ate through the metal on the railings.
On the other side of the truck, the belt had been burned through so thoroughly that the holster was dripping wax, which melted off the rubber on the tires.


Jasmine lurched right as a car pulled up in front of her,  then back left as she felt the sensation of a tire popping off. She looked into her mirror and screamed. The trunk looked like a sped up video of moths eating a living room. everything was crumpled and eaten, with bite marks here and bite marks there. Worst yet, she knew the real cause wasn’t moths.
Wilkins scrambled back to the edge of the trunk, closest to Jasmine. He pulled out a pocket knife lying around and flipped out the knife edge, which happened to be worn away so much from boy scouts. He swore and flipped out a spoon. “This’ll do the trick,” he muttered.


With the help of Darrell, Wilkins plunged the spoon into the lever in the back window, as the flames crept slowly towards them, melting away the entire frame of the trunk. He twisted the spoon and-pop!- the window sprung upwards with ease. The two clambered into the back of the truck, huffing and puffing in horror. “Mr. Wu might’ve pulled the pin on Wilkins’ belt!” exclaimed Darrell, hyperventilating. Jasmine tried to ease it. “Look, the border. It’ll be about twenty or thirty seconds away!” Wilkins cut in.
“In twenty or thirty seconds I’m not even sure you can call this a truck!”
“Just press down on the gas!”
“On first gear!? Not way!” At that moment, A flame erupted from the back of the truck, as the blazing heat made it’s way towards the suspension in the back wheels. The entire front half was blown upwards and in a flip and landed at the foot of a parking lot.


Wilkins pulled open the window as the car somersaulted and jumped out. “This way!” They all landed in sequence, hitting the pavement as the car exploded into flames. The three scrambled up and stumbled away into the lot, just as the border patrol guard ran forth to investigate.
They all slipped under a tarp, where a car was hiding under, and Wilkins used the keys he’d jacked from Mr. Wu to open it. They all climbed inside.
The car wasn’t the normal car you’d expect it to be. The seats and other accesories had been replaced by one thin plate of zirconium which would serve as an elevator. Wilkins looked into the cupboard of the car and pulled out a thick bundle of wires and hafnium, then looked around for the plugs. He found all four nestling under a nest of synthetic rubber cords.


With the help of his friends, Wilkins managed to pull out the four plugs and reconnect them to the corresponding letters on the other side of the computer.
Suddenly, the entire car rattled, and the plate of zirconium started shuddering down two rails situated on either side of the car. The rest of the car, however, did not move. They reached the bottom quickly, opened up the safety gates that blocked them, and climbed out.


There was a thick, musty air clinging to the trio as they trudged along a dirt path, Jasmine asking questions as she shivered in the tunnel.
“W-what is this?” she chattered, shuffling to try to increase her body heat. Wilkins pulled out a small lantern from his pocket and turned it on as the light dimmed. Jasmine gasped. The entire place was a mine shaft.
“The border’s built on top of it,” explained Wilkins explained as the lantern flickered, “And we’ve bypassed it...just about now-” a spray of bullets fired out of nowhere, singing the ends of Wilkins’ hair. In the distance, he heard a faint “Down down down!” He was being followed.


Another bullet raced out of the darkness and shredded the synthetic bulletproof thread of his button-down. The three raced down a tunnel, ran into a fork, and ducked into a pit as a halo of metal showered over them. Specks of dirt flew everywhere. They all clambered out, mud soaking their faces, bullets following them on their heels. One of the men fired a bullet, and Wilkins jumped as it smashed through the glass of the lantern, barely missing the core. A smoky scent wafted up into their noses. A few more bullets punched into a mine cart ahead of them, and the trio turned away from that path. There was a three way path waiting for them. Wilkins chose the middle one, and Darrell and Jasmine followed. Another fork. The tunnel crept lower and narrower. A spray of bullets lined the walls, and they all shuffled faster through the tunnel and found a grate waiting for them. All of them scrambled through the bars and found themselves in a sewer path. “This way!” an echo bounced along the walls. The footsteps died down. A murmur of voices arose.
“You think...buy it...nearly complete-”
“Speed up...phase three...Project Taurus...”


They found a grate that Wilkins knew was in a back alley. “I’ve been here a lot-trust me.” They climbed out of the grate and pulled it back in place. “Okay,” he started, “Darrell, arm the entrance. I’ll keep you covered.” He turned to jasmine and clutched her arm. “You find Katie. I know she’s somewhere around here.” She nodded and dashed off.
A few minutes later he noticed something. Leaning against the walls, in the shadows, was a man, smoking a cigar so big that it looked about twice the length of his palm. There was a thick cloud of smoke billowing from it every time he inhaled. His boots reached up to the middle of his shins, and the hat he wore brimmed with gold. The man dipped his cigar down, exhaled with a smoky flamethrower breath and-Wlkins glanced a bulbous shape glistening inside the cigar, and he realized why the cigar was so big: It was a camera.


He suddenly felt himself darting towards the man. He stepped out of the alley, shimmying away as if it were an illusion. Wilkins turned the corner and stopped cold in his tracks. As if magic, there was no man with a cigar there. He glanced left to right, up and down, and ran back into the alley, where Darrell had removed a portion of the brick wall and was climbing into the back of a hunter’s shop.
The back portion of the shop had been owned by Stanley Henwinson, Wilkins’ older brother (and the person Wilkins mentioned during the acceptions.), which was what allowed him to turn a closet pullout into a laboratory.


Stanley was waiting for him when he climbed in. “Hey Wilkins,” he greeted his younger brother with a thick englishman’s accent, which he’d picked up from his 7 years at Oxford and Humboldt (he got into Oxford at the age of 10, and Humboldt when he was 13. Wilkins will be there (sort of) next year.), “Whadda ya want?” He stood up from the couch. There was an antiquity in the room, which was so small, Stanley’s 16K TV nearly crossed the length of it. He pulled out the pullout bed from the closet, which had been rendered into a weapon holster, every little trinket bound in egyptian cashmere that had been strung across the bed. Stanley swiped a Hi-Chew off the table and handed it to Wilkins. “Don’t eat it yet,” he chuckled. “This thing significantly overloads your adrenal glands, so you’ll react better and move faster. It lasts for about a minute and a half, or until the flavour runs out, so I designed the wrapper so that it syncronizes with the smartwatch on your wrist. Just tap it to the watch and open stopwatch.” He checked his watch. “Gods,” he exclaimed. “Half a minute until the estimated time of the ‘supposed rapture.’ I’ll meet you there.”


The bartender, beer-bellied and hairy, was suprised when a boy walked in, fair brunette with a button-down and khaki pants. He was greeted by another, taller but identical version of him, who sat him down and handed him a whiskey. “Kids ain’t allowed here, boy.” Everybody laughed. The boy didn’t budge. “I didn’t know you thought in terms of height, fat man.” Another beer belly stood up. “You don’t insult the bartender, little baby.” They all spoke with a light norse accent. The boy chuckled. “I don’t want to intterupt your playtime. As long as I’m here, I’m an adult-19 and a half, if you need the bloody age.” A canadien/english accent filled his voice. The bartender rattled the counter with a huge beer bottle and popped off the cap, dumping the entire litre into a lorge glass. “Have a glass. I hope you go drunk.” Another man stood up, his eyes covered by thick eyebrows and his entire body blocky and muscled. He snatched the glass around and returned to his seat,  almost inhaling the alcohol until the glass was empty. He slammed it down. Glass shards flew everywhere. The boy ducked, and muttered an “Eeergh” as a sliver cut his palm. He covered it with his thumb.


Three more men stood up, including the blocky man and the bartender, and reached for their pockets. The boy stood up, and the taller twin also did so, slowly reaching for his back pocket.
Wilkins knew that at this stage, it was going to be a shootout. He had a squib on his wrist and had ejected a thin slip of red colouring when the man slammed his glass down and sent the glass soaring across the room. That was the time he’d palmed his Hi-Chew. Stanley was looking around. He knew that everyone was going to pull out a gun. Exactly why he had a pack of cigarettes hiding in his back pocket was unknown to Wilkins.


The two ducked as a bullet charred the wall, followed by another blur of 3 millimetre long metal that punched through the mural hanging there. Stanley took out his cigarette pack from his pocket. “Here,” he said as he lit it with the tiny lighter he’d stored into the side of the packet, “It’s a tranquilizer blowstraw. 2 tranquilizers a cigarette.” Wilkins kicked over a table as a halo of bullets raced across the room and into the cushy chairs at the other end. He staggered across the room and jumped onto the edge of a table as a bullet zipped past his ear and smashed into a trophy decor sitting on a ledge. The table flipped up and knocked a man in the jaw. He barely flinched. Wilkins swallowed and reached for the chair with his legs, flipped it over and knocked the man in the stomach. Again, no flinch. He rolled up and grabbed the chair by the end, knocking him in the face and sending him sprawling across the floor near the entrance. The bar had been filed out of. As Wilkins raised the chair for another blow, a spray of bullets smashed though the wood and out of the window, where men and women were screaming. He dropped it and rolled over the counter. The bartender was just out of the bar, stuck in the doorway, where Wilkins got a clean shot with his tranquilizer. It drove into his skin, square in the stomach, where he should have dropped unconscious. He didn’t even blink. Wilkins ducked as he fired a bullet and tossed a volley of wine glasses over his head.


The entire place was unraveling like a funhouse party, though it was nowhere near fun or house-like. Wilkins felt like he might die any moment, his lifelong dream of making an AI that would strangle him to death as he sat in the medical room, all washing away. He was completely blind, sawdust flying everywhere. At that moment he decided he should use the Hi-Chew.
He tapped the thick, stiff wrapper to his watch and opened the clock as he ducked behind the counter, a volley of bullets smashing into a bottle of merlot. Wine soaked his heels. He weighed the Hi-Chew in his hand and, in a single quick motion, tossed it into his mouth and chewed it.


The effect, after a second or so, was immediate. Time slowed down. He saw a bullet race towards him at a jogger’s pace. He raised his arm up and watched, in awe, as it caught, and slowly cut through, the sleeve of his t-shirt. He ducked. It took nearly ages. He glimpsed a bullet walk towards the refrigerator and let the glass swallow it up like a wormhole.
Slowly, he raced over the counter and leap up for the balcony, flipping over it. He flet as if he had been cast into a scene in The Matrix.
A man raised his gun up to Wilkins. He ducked to the side as the bullet fired. As if being pulled off the wall, he lulled away and knocked the man off the balcony and ducked as 16 accurately counted bullets sprayed into the wall and into a man’s stomach. He staggered and fell, slumped against the doorway of the fire escape.


A minute and a half seemed like millenium to Wilkins as he weaved in and out of the beer bellies firing their guns at him. Stanley had incapacitated nearly all of them, leaving one man left.
At this one crucial moment, Wilkins felt his entire body weigh on top of him like a millions pounds. Time suddenly warped back into perception. He staggered backwards. “Uh...” the last man fired a bullet that shredded his pant leg and sent him tumbling back.
Stanley needed another tranquilizer, and the last one was in Wilkins’ cigarette. he kicked the man in the shin and ran up the stairs, where an unconscious Wilkins lay. He pulled the cigarette out of his pocket and lept aside as a bullet knocked a painting off the wall and onto his younger brother, who grunted as it landed on his head. Stanley aimed his tranquilizer at the man and shot it. It snuggled comfortably into his beard before he dropped like a corpse.


Darrell met a nearly unconscious Wilkins being carried by Stanley. He nodded and helped, slinging his friend’s arm over his shoulder and walking away from the wreckage.
News about the shootout rang straight into Ms. and Mr. Henwinson’s ears as they were choosing a swimming bra. It was on TV in the shop, all news blaring about a group of counterterrorists saving a bar from a majority of bartenders and heavy drinkers. At that same moment, Ms. Henwinson got a text from Wilkins. She smiled at the message: Can I stay at Stanley’s house for tonight? She, completely brainwashed about the grounding, texted back Okay.
Minutes later she got another text reading that he’d left.


## Sherlock Holmes and the case of the mangled Stanley




Wilkins lay down on the stretcher, which had been produced from the attic of the house, the only other place that Stanley had access to. His older brother found a dusty stack of boxes and pulled the lid off of the second one from the top, producing a jar of honey. Slowly, he poured a teaspoon of it into a glass of water, added a sugar cube and mixed until it was only water. Then he set some down on the bedside table. There was a knock on the door and Stanley climbed down, returning with a dog. A shnauzer, with a note in it’s mouth. “Katie!” exclaimed Darrell. He ran over and picked her off of Stanley’s hands. Her skin was furry and soft. Darrell set her on top of Wilkins and pulled the note out of Katie’s mouth:
At home. Trying to find out about Project Taurus. Computer crashed.


Wilkins awoke in Stanley’s attic to find Katie sitting on top of him. He smiled. Katie was holding a glass of honey water between her paws. He drank down the glass and felt a warmth surge through his skin. He felt better after his adrenaline surge. Walking downstairs, he found an empty room and an Ipad waiting for him. It was on, and had been opened to an RC app. He guessed by the blackness, that he was in a backpack. Wilkins tapped at the screen, and a number of simple controls appeared. He tapped the start button. The robbot whirred, then took off. He was flying.
Suddenly, Stanley greeted him. “Hey, Bro,” he laughed, “Turn on the headlamps.” he did, and the blackness lit up. It was maybe 9 o’clock, and he was in the middle of a street. Tall apartments rose over him to his right. The streetlamps weren’t doing such a good job.


“Steer over, and find Jasmine. She’s also a drone. Just find her on West 6 and Downing, near the third streetlamp near the bridge. She’ll see you.”
After a short period of steering and flying around, he finally found jasmine, a small, bright twinkle of light. “Hey Jazz,” he spoke through an intercom. Jasmine replied with a warm, “Hey.” They both, though they didn’t know it, smiled in unison.
Stanley was waiting for them both. “Good job so far,” he praised, “Now Wilkins, get over here, Jasmine fly overhead of the alleyway on 7th and Burlock to check there.” Wilkins was jogging past the bridge and nearly at the alley. He stopped at the foot of the bridge like told so.


Wilkins veered the drone just at the foot of the alleyway, turning off his light and tuning up the volume. According to Stanley, there were speakers on the drone, but they’d been placed behind a thin layer of carbon fiber shielding, so they couldn’t pick up sound as well. He was looking around for Stanley when he heard a quiet murmur of voices eminationg from the speakers on his Ipad. “They took us out like-” there was a snap of fingers, a crackle of sound on the speakers. Wilkins recognised the snap. It was Jerry Lou’s. No snap could have been louder. He listened intently. Suddenly, the drone’s camera adjusted, and he saw the faces of all the people in the alley, bruised and drowsy. There were cuts on their foreheads and purple eyes that made them look as if they’d been put through a boxing match and failed every point. It was the science group cult. So they were wearing fat suits, thought Wilkins. He pondered further. “But who supplied them?” he murmured under his breath. He pushed the drone in further. There was a second voice. “I assure you, they’ve been crippled. And if they haven’t, you know what to do.” The voice had supplied the suits. He was sure of it.
Suddenly there was a woosh, and Wilkins turned around to find  a leaf, sailing in the air. He exhaled. There was a sudden smash, and he looked down to find static on his Ipad screen. He grabbed the Ipad and ran.
The alley wasn’t hard to find, but he quickly ran into Stanley, hiding in McDonalds with his head down, sipping a latte.
“What's t-” Stanley pushed his head down. “Look!”
A boy with a hoodie and headphones trudged into the cafe and looked around. He ordered a smoothie and looked around for a seat, but the two knew better. He was trying to find them. Wilkins felt a lump in his throat. It he let out with a cough, the boy would spot him. He kept it in. The boy turned around and looked. He shuffled over to the stairs and sat there, waiting for his smoothie. The lump moved further up his throat, as if he were a swimmer and he was running out of air. As soon as the boy moved for his smoothie, the lump shifted down his throat until it was just about level with his adam’s apple.


If he moved, he would alert the boy. If he coughed, the same would happen. In the distance, he spotted a group of boys looking around on the bridge. He swallowed. The boy looked up and around. Pretending to look for his own earphones, Wilkins breathed a sigh of relief. And just then, a boy looking for him spotted his face.
He dashed across the street, flipped out his phone and started calling the others. There was a brief moment before the hoodie boy took out an old Nokia and studied it for a moment, maybe weighing the odds. He then shrugged and answered. Wilkins slowly pulled his chair out and tiptoed through the cafe. Lightbulbs were flickering on and off as men and women shuffled in and out through the sliding glass doors of McDonald's, talking and chuckling, murmuring, gossiping. They all forgot about Wilkins and Stanley for a second or so, ignoring them even as they bumped and staggered into customers like ping pong balls.


Just as they got out, Wilkins felt a cold arm grab his. He spun around and, blindly, threw all his body weight into a back kick. The figure grunted and fell back. He stepped forwards and pressed his hand on where he knew was the throat and held the figure down. There was a pleading, “Stop!” and Wilkins pulled his broken lantern up to his face and glimpsed a merciful customer before Stanley pulled him up.
“Sorry,” he murmured, then turned to Stanley. But Stanley wasn’t there. There was a swish behind him. Just a leaf, thought Wilkins. He ran, cradling the Ipad, back to Stanley’s house.
Halfway across the bridge, he heard the swish again. He whirled around to find nothing standing there. And then he felt it. A racing wind that lasted for a fraction of a second, nearly brushing past his face. Careful, Wilkins looked around in the dead night and noticed a leaf, with a gaping hole in it. Crunching it underfoot, he circled around the roads of the bridge until he noticed another leaf with the same gaping hole. A bullet shot, thought Wilkins. There was a clang, a screech, and a thud, and Wilkins lunged and stopped dead on his tracks. Pulling out his lantern, he saw a lock, with a charred body and broken mechanism. There was a chip in the gate where the lock once hung. Growing anxious, Wilkins shone his lantern around. It was near midnight. The moon was full. He studied the bridge further, and after a short period of time noticed something suspicious. There were no bullet marks or ashes. He pondered this.


Suddenly, there was a wish of air that barely brushed his ear, leaving a slight burn. Metal, thought Wilkins. And if there were no ashes or burns, they had to be-
“Knives!” yelled Wilkins, as a volley sprouted from the foot of the bridge. He staggered up and ran. A knife lodged into the brickwork just ahead of Wilkins as he veered to a stop. Another spray of sharp metal sliced past the adhesive on the railing of the bridge, and Wilkins ran off to the left, just as his shirt was torn off by a swirl of knives that stabbed into the wall. He ran ahead.
He stopped at a pair of railroad tracks, then ran back to the bridge and found another knife slam into the brickwork and pavement. He ran back.


Wilkins stopped when he felt his foot soaked in water. He looked up. There was no rain. He looked around. No glass or metal. Suddenly, he knew it was blood. What else would it be?
Kneeling down, he examined the surroundings. It had been fresh blood, maybe spilling about four or five minutes ago. He shuffled forwards and noticed a finger, lying on the ground and twitching furiously. The darkness made it impossible to tell what it was. Wilkins pulled out his lantern and tried to turn it on, and was met by a flicker as the bullet, lodged inside, had burned through the wiring. He swore. But maybe there was internet. He hoped so.


Turning on the Ipad, he filed through the apps and opened app store. An unsatisfying “Connection Timed Out” appeared on the screen, and Wilkins swore. Even if he stood, two inches from the them, he wouldn’t be able to make out his own hands.
Wilkins went and opened camera. Turning on the flash, he held his thumb on the camera button and watched as the flash lit up and blinked on and off like a fly beating it’s wings. He managed to see the entire body before the light burned out and smoke curled around the Ipad. It was Stanley.


He’d been gagged and branded to the side of the road, maimed for Wilkins to see. It was sick, twisted and yet the science room cult had managed to do such a thing. Killing is for adults and not for kids. Wilkins could remember qoutes like that, gouged in his head as he saw Stanley there.
He peeled off the duct tape on his brother’s mouth and watched him, though nearly invisibly, gasp for air. He huffed.
“They,” he heaved out that one word as he grunted though clenched teeth, “They took me round the back alley and dragged me here when you weren’t looking. There’re brands on my arms...” He eyeballed his hand, which was bathed in red liquid, all drying up. Wilkins looked at the metal brand.


It looked like something you saw out of a soap opera for medieval knights, with steel bolts and spiks protruding out in every direction. Blood was flushing out of it, and Wilkins presumed there was a knife, or other sharp object, stopping the wound from sealing. He took a penny out of his pocket and started unscrewing the bolt.
Minutes later, Wilkins had nearly finished freeing his brother from agony. He pulled off the last bolt, capped the buckle and pulled Stanley out from the cuffs. The two staggered home in disorientation.
“Where’s Darrell?” asked Wilkins as they limped across the bridge.
“His parents are on a business trip, so he can do whatever he wants. So long as he doesn’t blow up their house.” The two laughed, then trudged along.
“So, where is he?”
“Probably at my house. He’ll sleep in the attic with you.”


Sure enough, Darrell was waiting for them, shocked by their appearance. He was stroking Katie. Stanley sat down, bandaged his arm and ordered Wilkins to take out the small crate of syringes resting in the attic. After doing so, Stanley pulled one out.
It was a standard syringe, all except for the barbed tip and green liquid sitting in the vial.
“The liquid is a sirum, designed to work like an artificial platelet. Though it works much better than one, given the speed that it comes into play,” Stanley explained. he then injected a quarter of a vial into his wound and watched as the sirum spread itself out and dried as a scab, completely sealing the wound.
Three more injections later, Stanley’s wounds were healing faster than ever. He was slowly getting better.


Wilkins got up at six o’clock, groggy eyed but awake. He scrambled out of bed and tiptoed down the stairs, wanting to do some investigating.
The man had said something about the cult “crippling us down.” And what would be the very first and foremost easiest thing to do to cripple any organization? Show it outright to the world, that’s what. So Wilkins was out to do something. But what could he do? He thought about the next thing they might do: tell the police. But that was too cliche. Wilkins knew they wouldn’t ever in their right mind do that. It might be more or less elaborate. It could be as out of this world as setting up and systematically voyeuring them to learn their routine, or as simple as setting up a thick old box camera trap in their house. He thought another way. What’s the easiest but most sensibly elaborate thing they’ll do in a turf war? Wilkins saw the pattern. The fat suits, and the shootout. An invisible figure, but a nearly unsurvivable knife assault. Little precautions, but unsurmountable acts. Wilkins thought. What fits the pattern? Or maybe advances them ahead of us.


Recruits, thought Wilkins.

## Volume Two of the Great Escape


### Sam-At His House on MiddleDew Lane


The blanket was strewn over the side of the bed as Sam got out of bed and walked around to his nightstand, where a three page booklet of Kumon waited for him. He smiled and ignored it, skipping down the stairs and to Blake Dukakis’ house.
The Dukakis’ were a bit laid-back, or lazy as others might call it, sometimes going to their private island unexpectadly, or traveling on road trips with friends. But Blake didn’t like any of this. He’d seen, everywhere, how this escalated. He didn’t like it. So here he was, greeted by a defiant Sam, who was holding a paper in his hand. It was a booklet, three pages thick, with rather simple questions. Or so he thought. Sam didn’t even ask if he wanted it. He just shoved it into his hands and slammed the door behind him.


Wilkins saw it all from the balcony he’d been nesting on. Using rope from Stanley’s laboratory, he’d slung it over the ledge with a piece of wire attached to his chord and climbed up. Using the pieces he could find, he’d quickly fashioned a pair of high powered binoculars in a matter of minutes. He was looking three miles ahead of him.
Using the binoculars was like putting on a vr headset: you knew the focusing, the distance, focus and all.
He noticed Sam slam the door and walk back to his house. A shadow cast over his head. The trees loomed in front of him. The buildings in the background were warm and cottage like. Wilkins felt as if he was staring at a miniature set in his bedroom closet (all made from his 3D printer).


He scaled down the balcony, detatched his makeshift grappling hook from the ledge and tiptoed down behind a tree, where he got a good look at where his target was, walking back to his house with a grin on his face. He took out the cigarette packet he’d jacked from Stanley and took out the last cigarette of the box, which happened to have one precious dart left. Tiptoeing further and behind another tree, Wilkins glanced further down the road. Sam turned a corner. He lit his cigarette and followed him further, right at the edge of the turn. He readied his shot. Inhaled deeply. He focused. the cigarette met his lips. He blew, and...


There was a sudden blur, and Wilkins was knocked off his feet just as he fired, spinning in the air, and hitting the pavement with a grunt. He looked up. His vision was blurred. He tried to stand, but he felt the road going uphill. He lost his footing and hit the ground again. Ahead of him lay a boy with a deep gash in his head and scratches on his hands. He presumed that the boy had blocked the tranquilizer just before he’d fired. Wilkins staggered to his feet with all his strength. The world twisted in every direction. He hit the wall. His eyes spun. Sam was walking towards him. He twist his foot back and lashed out with a kick that would have taken Sam’s head out, but the kick met nothing. There was a sudden jolt, and he flew off his feet onto the road, where a horrified driver had braked abruptly and flown off the road. The car skidded and flew in a whirlwind of metal and glass, hitting the cement like an earthquake had shaken it off it’s hinges. All the glass was shattered. The neighborhood hadn’t woken up. Wilkins hadn’t either.


Sam walked over to the car. The driver was unconscious. He reached past the broken window, grabbed the driver’s keys from under the airbag and unlocked the door. He pulled the driver out and onto the grass beside a tree and dragged the unconscious Wilkins into the trunk and started the car with the key. Luckily for him, the driver had been keen not to change his car to modern day ones, which may have made a huge impact on how easily Sam could have taken it.
Early day commuters would have seen a devastatingly crunched KIA, with a driver that had barely achieved his driver’s license. But the truth was, that the boy hadn’t even gotten his driver’s license. He wasn’t even sixteen. And what he had in his trunk would scare any and all men and woman away.


Wilkins’ vision cleared. He looked around. There was a bruise on his neck where Sam had kicked him. Scratches lined his arms. There was a deep gash on his back. And he was chained to a wooden post.
A boy walked up to him. He was tall, and just as tall as the post. His fingers were skinny. He looked like a monkey. Jerry Lou, thought Wilkins. He tried to back out of the post. Jerry threw his fist forward and jabbed him in the stomach. Wilkins flinched, then lurched forwards. Jerry smiled. “You’re strong,” he remarked. He walked out of the room.
Wilkins was in a barn-like area, full of haystacks and levers and chains. He thought he remembered it. The glass panels on either side of the barn were shattered, and the ones remaining were so covered in grease and grime that they looked close to opaque. Ahead were clutters and heaps of files and guns. So It was America. There was an old and rusted american flag drooping over the girder above him. Another clue. The sun had risen, though it was half buried by the horizon. That was a dead ringer.


It was near spring break. Maybe around eight o’clock in the morning, since he’d gotten up at six and would most likely have been out for two hours. The sun would have risen just high enough to leave the horizon, if he was in America. But it hadn’t risen quite enough to do so. So he was in Canada. Wilkins glanced around. There were slacks and chains hidden behind the haystacks. A twisty pipe ran up the side of the wall and snaked up and out of the building. What looked like an out of shape chugger was lurching side to side with every movement that Wilkins made. Lots of things that he could never have considered looking at. But there was a one crucial thing that Wilkins had to find. He glanced around. He could be about half a foot off the ground, chained to the post, which had been plunged into the ground. He shimmyed left and right. His clothes flapped lightly as he did so. The thick chains on his wrists and ankles were a tad bit too big for him. He might be able to slip through them with enough patience. Of course, he was thinking starving himself to get skinnier so he could escape.


Wilkins loathed that very thought. So he got to work.
